                <h5>What is VALORANT?</h5>
                <p><b>Valorant is a free-to-play first-person hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Microsoft Windows</b>. First teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by an official release on June 2, 2020. The development of the game started in 2014. <b>Valorant takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series of tactical shooters, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while moving.,</b></p>
                <h5>How do you play VALORANT?</h5>

                <hr/>
                <h6>Classic - Free</h6>
                <p>Is a pistol that all players receive upon spawning. This gun has two firing modes, a semi-auto single bullet primary and a semi-auto shotgun secondary.</p>
                <h6>Shorty - 200</h6>
                <p>The cheapest purchasable weapon in the game. As a sidearm equivalent of a shotgun, it is most effective at short range to instantly take an enemy by surprise.</p>
                <h6>Frenzy - 450</h6>
                <p>The Frenzy is a low-cost automatic pistol. As a sidearm equivalent of an SMG, it's not too punishing to use on the move at short ranges, making it most effective at that range and the best sidearm to use in such scenarios, though to challenge enemies who have full-bought getting headshots will most likely be necessary.</p>
                <h6>Ghost - 500</h6>
                <p>The Ghost is a low-cost semi-automatic pistol. Equipped with a large magazine and a silencer, it can be used to spam through vision blockers without much risk to the player's ammo count or positioning.</p>
                <h6>Sheriff - 800</h6>
                <p>The Sheriff is a semi-automatic revolver and the most expensive sidearm in the game. Able to kill enemies with a single bullet to the head at most ranges and health totals, it can be used to challenge even enemies who have full-bought. It's high penetration and extra reserve magazine also makes it useful for spamming for wallbangs during pistol or eco rounds.</p>

            </div>
            <div id="smg">
                <h6>SMGs (Submachine Guns) - Commonly used when credits are lacking for a rifle but enough for this kind. Also used during bonus rounds.</h6> 
                <hr/>
                <h6>Stinger - 950</h6>
                <p>The Stinger is a low-cost SMG. It has two firing modes, a standard automatic single-bullet primary fire and a semi-automatic burst-mode alternate fire that fires four bullets in a burst at around an eighth of its usual fire rate. Alternate fire also increases the distance that falloff damage begins to occur at.</p>
                <h6>Spectre - 1600</h6>
                <p>The Spectre is a moderately-priced SMG. Equipped with a large magazine and a silencer, it can be used to spam through vision blockers without much risk to the player's ammo count or positioning.</p>

            </div>

                <h6>Shotguns - Moderately priced guns that are powerful in close range fights but weaker at mid to long range ones.</h6>
                <hr/>
                <h6>Bucky - 850 </h6>
                <p>The Bucky is a low-cost shotgun and the cheapest primary weapon in the game. It has two firing modes, a standard single-shell primary fire and a canister alternate fire that allows the shell to travel a short distance before spraying its pellets instead of immediately spraying from the barrel of the gun, allowing the user to deal some damage to targets at medium range. Shells shot using Alternate Fire only produce a reduced amount of pellets however, and enemies hit by the canister before it reaches the required distance to explode will only take 1 pellet worth of damage. </p>
                <h6>Judge - 1850</h6>
                <p>The Judge is a moderately-priced automatic shotgun. It is best used in situations that put the user in close range against multiple enemies, being able to wipe them out quickly should they risk not clearing such small areas beforehand. As with all shotguns, the Judge has pellet spread that can be reduced by crouching, though the spread still makes it effectively useless at long ranges no matter what. Unlike the other shotguns however, the Judge does not have a distance cap on its pellets and can hit enemies beyond 50 meters.</p>

                <h6>LMGs (Lightmachine Guns) - Medium to high priced guns that penetrates walls easily and has a high ammo count.</h6>
                <hr/>
                <h6>Ares - 1600</h6>
                <p>The Ares is a medium-cost machine gun. Unlike most other guns that gets less accurate as you continuously fire more bullets from them, the Ares is the only gun in the game that gets more accurate as it is continuously fired. As a machine gun, it is most effective as either a defensive tool to hold a site or when used to get wallbang kills due to its high penetration, rate of fire, and magazine capacity. Their lower mobility and higher equip speeds however make them less suited for peeking or entering sites, something better served at such a price by SMGs.</p>
                <h6>Odin - 3200</h6>
                <p>The Odin is a high-cost machine gun. When using Primary Fire, the Odin's fire rate will increase over the duration the weapon is fired to a maximum amount, but using Alternate Fire will allow the user to shoot at that maximum fire rate immediately.</p>
                <hr/>
            <div id="assault">
                <h6>Sniper & Assault Rifles - The most used type of weapon. This weapon group offers the best value for money among all said weapon groups.</h6>
                <hr/>
                <h6>Bulldog</h6>
                <p>The Bulldog is a moderately-priced rifle. It has two firing modes, a standard automatic single-bullet primary fire and a semi-automatic burst-mode alternate fire that fires three bullets in an accurate burst at around a fifth of its usual fire rate. Very effective in bonus rounds </p>
                <h6>Guardian</h6>
                <p>The Guardian is a moderately-priced semi-automatic rifle. It is most effective in long-range fights in the hands of players who are confident in their ability to hit headshots at such distances, being more accurate than a Vandal.</p>
                <h6>Phantom</h6>
                <p>The Phantom is a high-cost automatic rifle. One of VALORANT's best general-purpose weapons, it is most effective at short to medium range where it is able to spray down multiple enemies at once due to its high rate of fire.</p>
                <h6>Vandal</h6>
                <p>The Vandal is a high-cost automatic rifle. One of VALORANT's best general-purpose weapons, it is most effective at picking off individual targets at longer ranges due to having no falloff, allowing it to kill any enemy with a single headshot at all ranges.</p>
                <h6>Marshal</h6>
                <p>The Marshal is a low cost sniper rifle. As a sniper, it has a scope with a single zoom setting on its Alternate Fire mode that has perfect accuracy when standing still. Despite sniper rifles usually being extremely inaccurate when used in Primary Fire mode, the Marshal is surprisingly accurate in this case, meaning it can be used to take on multiple enemies at once so long as the user can hit their shots.</p>
                <h6>Operator</h6>
                <p>The Operator is a high-cost sniper rifle and the most expensive gun in the game. As a sniper, it has a scope with two zoom settings on its Alternate Fire mode that has perfect accuracy when standing still. The Operator's Primary Fire accuracy on the other hand is extremely inaccurate.</p>

                <hr/>
                <h6>Double Initiator Lineup (ie. Chamber, Fade, KAY/O, Viper, Raze)</h6>
                <img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/blt6f1392b30784e029/618d9da0d380f814d61f001c/WebUpdate_Chamber_KeyArt.png" style="height:200px;">

                <p>In a Double Initiator Lineup like above, the team prioritizes gathering and flushing information out. Using such gathered information, the team can adjust in different ways, for example: if the Fade Haunt detects only one (1) person defending a site, the KAY/O can use his knife to disable the enemy and enable the Raze to entry-frag while the Chamber is holding flank. In a situation in where the Fade Haunt detects more than two (2) people in a site, they can a.) rotate for the Chamber holding flank or b.) pop a KAY/O ult or flash while making a synchronized entry from the Raze, a Viper wall and a Fade prowler.</p>
                <h6>Double Sentinel Lineup (ie. Chamber, Sage, Sova, Viper, Reyna) [mostly used in ICEBOX]</h6>
                <img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/blt6f1392b30784e029/618d9da0d380f814d61f001c/WebUpdate_Chamber_KeyArt.png" style="height:200px;">

                <p>In a Double Sentinel Lineup, defending sites is your speciality, but there are ways this strategy can work in the attacker side, for example: the Sova can drone for info, the Reyna can enter Icebox B site, the Sage uses the wall to cover the planter using the Viper orb. But in defending, Sage has her wall and slows in her disposal, Chamber has his trademark and can play off-angles using his teleport.</p>
                <h6>Double Controller Lineup (ie. Viper, Brimstone, Raze, Skye, Chamber) [mostly used in BIND]</h6>
                <img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/bltc825c6589eda7717/5eb7cdc6ee88132a6f6cfc25/V_AGENTS_587x900_Viper.png" style="height:200px ;">

                <img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/blt6f1392b30784e029/618d9da0d380f814d61f001c/WebUpdate_Chamber_KeyArt.png" style="height:200px;">
                <p>In a Double Controller Lineup, attacking sites are almost a breeze (depending on the enemies' lineup for defense). This kind of lineup is mostly used in very open maps that have many opening such as Bind. Using the example, the Viper can use her wall to cross through Lamps, Brimstone can use his three smokes on heaven and the gaps between Triple and Truck. This strategy opens up the map for the Chamber and Raze to pick off enemies with the Skye support.</p>
